I would like to thank Professor Matthew Piggott and Dr James Percival for their insightful guidance. Without their help, this thesis could not have reached its present form. I would also like to thank my friend Qizhi, Cai whose brilliant ideas have proved immensely constructive. Finally, my thanks would go for my parents for their unlimited support for me all the time.
